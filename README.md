This is a group project i completed during my studies at the University of San Diego (ADS-50B).
The focus of the project is to evaluate correlation between the dependent variable (home price) and independent variables (home characteristics such as sqaure feet).
Additionally, the aim was to also find the optimal (linear) regression model to predict prices.

NOTE: this model is using national data. Thus, predictions may not be accurate.
